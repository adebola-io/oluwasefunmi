Alhamdulillah and Hallelujah, I have done it!

After years of hand-wringing, bike-shedding and over-engineering, I have made a blog for me. A new internet home, where I will infrequently blab about anything and everything, to a silent, invisible and intimidating Schrödinger's audience.

Applause, applause. Thank you. Thank you so much.

I am still unsure about a lot of details, but I've decided that this corner of the internet will contain:

- technical tutorials and explorations,

- unasked-for and unwanted thoughts about the economic and political state of the world right now,

- documentations of my failed, successful and ongoing projects,

- arbitrary reflections that sound profound at 3 AM but look ridiculous in daylight, and lastly,

- the secret answer to life, the universe and everything.

The coin is still spinning in the air. Maybe this blog will just be another thing that starts with a grand declaration and fades into mental obscurity. Maybe I'll give up or get distracted after this first one. But that's part of the charm. I'm standing by it!

At some point, I will regret this first post and try to rewrite it to fit a future narrative. That's how these things tend to go. For now though, I refuse to overthink it. Write now, cringe later.

So, you are welcome, if you're there. Or don't feel welcome, it's your business.

Sefunmi made a blog. That is all for now.
